<p>Hi!</p>
<p>This is Kelly!</p>
<p>I know people are making fancy READMEs but I'm going to keep it simple</p>
<p>I'm learning some coding stuff because I don't want to look too stupid in front of my software engineer bf</p>

<h4>Facts about me?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>From Hong Kong. My 'English name' has nothing to do with my <i>real</i> name, but the name is a secretðŸ˜›</li>
  <li>Goes to NYU SPS. Arrived in America one year ago (time files!), still getting used to NYC cultures</li>
  <li>Started to make websites since I was taking a web design course, so far no classmate has taken HTML so far beyond like I do</li>
  <li>Joined github on my birthday</li>
</ol>
<p>idk what else to include... then I guess...</p>
<p>ciao ciao!</p>
