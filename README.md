_hi! this is kelly!_

I do know how to code a html site, but .md files are too convenient when it comes to making neat index display for my stuff<br>
that's why I'm here, using GitHub as my profile page<br>

I'm interested in books, but more interested in the transmission of messages through different channels<br>
that's why I want to be in the publishing industry!<br>

Pinned repos related to publishing:
- [`/travel-things/`](https://github.com/kelly990918/travel-things): Travel writings (mostly in Chinese)
- [`/NYU-Capstone-KongTone/`](https://github.com/kelly990918/NYUCapstone-KongTone): NYU capstone project - KongTone
- [`/NYU-Highlights/`](https://github.com/kelly990918/NYU-Highlights): Some creative course projects I did in the NYU MS in Publishing program
- [`/MA-thesis/`](https://github.com/kelly990918/kelly990918/blob/main/MA-thesis.pdf): Master's thesis on Sylvia Plath's _The Bell Jar_. A paper aiming to appreciate the intrinsic, artistic value of Plath's writing.
