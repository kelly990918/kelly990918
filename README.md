_hi! this is kelly!_

I do know how to code a html site, but .md files are too convenient when it comes to making neat index display for my stuff.<br>
That's why I'm here, using GitHub as my profile page.<br>

I'm interested in books, but more interested in the transmission of messages through different channels.<br>
That's why I want to be in the publishing industry!<br>

Pinned repos related to publishing:
- [`/travel-things/`](https://github.com/kelly990918/travel-things): Travel writings (mostly in Chinese) and some book reviews in [`/book-observations/`](https://github.com/kelly990918/travel-things/tree/main/book-observations)
