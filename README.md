Hi! <br>
This is Kelly! <br>
I know people are making fancy READMEs but I'm still figuring out how it works lmao <br>
I'm learning some coding stuff because I don't want to look too stupid in front of my software engineer bf
<br><br>
Facts about me? <br>
1. From Hong Kong. My 'English name' has nothing to do with my <i>real</i> name, but the name is a secret <br>
2. Goes to NYU. Arrived in America 10 months ago, still getting used to NYC cultures <br>
3. Started to make websites since I'm taking a web design course <br>
4. Coded a buggy website that needs a lot of improvements. But I am quite passionate about that
5. Joined github on my birthday
idk what else to include... then I guess... <br>
ciao ciao!
